# RSA Factoring Challenge

This repo contains solutions to the RSA Factoring Challenge. 
Two files are present besides this README file. Each file contains code
solutions to slightly different problems.  

## Getting started

* Open your terminal and clone this repo locally into a directory of your choice

```sh

git clone https://github.com/beingnile/RSA-Factoring-Challenge

```

* Navigate into the directory you cloned the repo into. You should
still be on the same directory. Open the directory RSA-Factoring-Challenge

```sh

cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge

```

You will notice two files in the repo besides `README.md`.  
The factors file factorizes many numbers as possible from a file into a product 
of two smaller numbers.  
The rsa file reads a number `n` from a file and factorizes it into two prime numbers
`p` and `q` such that `n = p x q`.
